# Shopping Cart

This React project is my implementation of TOP's [Shopping Card Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/react-new-shopping-cart).

The aim was to apply the React concepts learned so far and get a first hands-on practice with :
- testing a React Application
- styling a React Application
- using React Router

The products are fetched via the FakeStoreAPI and Netifly was used as deployment provider.
